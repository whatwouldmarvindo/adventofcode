## Day 13

I have to take some notes because I am getting confused..

The data points have a X and Y value.
Coming from the input, X is the first value and Y the second. They are separated by a comma

X increases to the right while `Y` increases downwards

There are `Y` and `X` folds.

`Y` folds up so it only affects the the `Y` values of the points (that's good)
